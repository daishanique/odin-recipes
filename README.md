Recipes project

This project is simply creating recipes. 
The purpose of this project is to showcase all that I have learned throughout the odin project up until this point. By the end of this project, I will have shown that I can create a website, add text and images, and modify when necessary. When modifications take place, I will show that I can properly commit messages.
