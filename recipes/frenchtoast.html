    <p>Delicious and decadent, simple spin on French toast. 
        Got the idea from a bed and breakfast in the south. 
        Add additional ingredients; we like blueberries and cream 
        cheese, cinnamon apples, nuts, and dried fruit!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.</li>
          <li>Stir 1 cup brown sugar and butter together in a saucepan 
              over medium-low heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves into 
              butter, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour into prepared baking dish and spread 
              a 1 1/2- to 2-inch layer of bread pieces over the top.</li>
          <li>Beat milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; pour milk 
              mixture over bread into the baking dish and move bread as necessary 
              to ensure all bread is absorbing liquid. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. 
              Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
          <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove and discard plastic 
              wrap from baking dish and sprinkle remaining brown sugar over the top of 
              the bread mixture.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
