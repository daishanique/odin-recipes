    <p>Spicy chicken with peanuts, similar to what is served in 
        Chinese restaurants. It is easy to make, and you can be 
        as sloppy with the measurements as you want. They reduce 
        to a nice, thick sauce. Substitute cashews for peanuts, 
        or bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts. You can't go 
        wrong! Enjoy!
